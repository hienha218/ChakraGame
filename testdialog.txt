Hi there!
I've never seen you before.
Are you new here?
Nice to meet you.
My name is Hikaru.
I am a college student.
I am conducting a research about Chakra.
Do you mind me asking some question?
Well, actually... Considering you are in this game...
I would say that the answer is no.
Ok, first question!
